            Hereâ€™s how it works?
          </h5>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 1.&nbsp;</strong>
            Design a high impact advertisement box that is eye-catching and
            tells members, very easily, what you are offering. The ad must be
            a 180 px X 150 px .jpg.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 2.&nbsp;</strong>
            Click on the Support Link in the left menu, select Advertising,
            and enter your contact info, and attach your ad. We will contact
            you for payment.

        <div className="text-container">
          <h5>
            How much does it cost?
          </h5>
          <p>
            When you fill out the get started form, you will be asked to provide
            your credit card info. The fee for this service is twenty-five dollars
            USD ($25.00). Once the advertising begins, the fee becomes non-refundable.
            You will be charged another $25 thirty days later. Should you wish to
            discontinue advertising simple open a support ticket under the advertising
            tab and explain clearly that you wish the ad to stop.
