            Through our Indy Author Book Sales & Fulfillment program,
            you have the ability to create a highly effective book page,
            market your book to our community and sell it.   You get to
            keep complete control of what your book page looks like, how
            it is marketed and what the retail price of your work is.
            When a book sells, we will collect the money from the
            customer and send you a notification to ship the book.
            Your job is to ship the book to the customer within 24 hours
            of receiving our notification.  After you send out the order,
            simple log into your orders page and update the order with
            appropriate tracking information.

            GoRead offers the most aggressive royalty book
            sales platform to independent authors, giving you as much as
            77% of the retail price of the sale.  Our program has 2
            tiers, if you receive an order, ship it & update you order
            page with tracking information within 24 hours, then you
            will receive 77% of the retail price.  If you exceed the 24
            hour mark, then you royalties will be 73% on that order.
            All royalties are paid 45 days after the last day of the
            month in which the order is fulfilled.  This delayed payment
            system is necessary to cover any potential returns or
            mailing challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the 15th of each month, the royalty distribution date,
            you will receive a full report of all sales and royalties,
            along with your royalty payment.   Please make sure that
            your banking information is accurate in your profile so that
            there are no delays in getting you your money.  Also, it is
            incredibly important that you keep your inventory levels
            accurate and list your book as “Out of Stock” in the event
            of temporary issues.

            At GoRead, our community is the most important part.
            We expect you to be prompt in your order fulfillment and to
            ship the customer only new quality works.  All books must be
            published and have an assigned ISBN.  The books must also be
            new and unused.  We will do our best to help you to operate
            efficiently and accurately.  We cannot, however, condone
            negative behaviour, slow or inaccurate shipping.  Whenever
            there is a delay in shipping, you are responsible to advise
            us as soon as possible, so that we can advise the customer.
            If the delay is longer then 48 hours without feedback from
            you, we will refund the customer and advise.  If we receive
            complaints or negative feedback about a book, shipping or an
            order, we will issue you an email warning. If you receive 3
            warnings, your account will be suspended until the challenge
            is fixed.
