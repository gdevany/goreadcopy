## WIP (Work In Progress)

### Todo:
* Create README that details how to run app
* Details on good react/redux patterns/conventions we should implement as we build.
* Developers need to know react, redux, es6 and webpack: share links and resources/explain basics.
* Create webpack dev and prod server configs
* Make sure everything works together.
* Will eventually need all `.env` credentials.
