# GoRead Frontend

## Overview

Being one of our main software development projects, GoRead Frontend is tasked with the responsibility of being the principal layer of interaction with our final users and handling part of our business logic during its operation.

It was initiated as an effort to migrate our previous frontend layer based on HAML templates for Python onto newer technologies and divide concerns between frontend and backend responsibilities. Since then, it has grown to become a full-fledged web application project that demanded constant attention by part of the team members.
